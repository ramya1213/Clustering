SYSTEMATIC CLUSTERING APPROACH FOR DATA UTILITY AND PRIVACY
Privacy preservation of individuals has gained major interest in data mining. From past years many techniques for preserving the sensitive information is addressed by existing literature. Anonymization technique is one among them, but this anonymization approach has major flow, it protects private information but lose valued information. Therefore the systematic clustering algorithm is used to get over from the major flow of anonymization approach. This proposed technique makes use of equal and unequal combination of quasi-identifier and sensitive attribute and then anonymizes each combination. Through which it ensures the data utility by producing the lesser number of attributes in generated sub-databases from original database which in turn leads to the lesser information loss and protect sensitive attribute. In addition, these approaches take lesser execution time than the traditional approaches.
